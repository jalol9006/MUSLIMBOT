### Quran

#### +quran

**To get a single verse:**
```
+quran [surah]:[verse] [translation]
```
For example:
```
+quran 1:1 french
```
**To get multiple verses:**
```
+quran [surah]:[firstVerse]-[lastVerse] [translation]
```
For example:
```
+quran 1:1-7 khattab 
```
The above command would quote Surah 1, Verses 1-7 (Surah al-Fatihah) using the translation of Dr Mustafa Khattab.

##### Valid translations
```
+translationlist
```


#### +aquran
functions exactly like  **+quran**, but sends the verses in Arabic.

For example, to quote the first verse of the Qur'an:
```
+aquran 1:1
```

#### +morphology
allows you to analyse the Arabic morphology of any word in the Qur'an.

```
+morphology [surah]:[verse]:[word number]
```

For example:
```
+morphology 1:2:4
```
The above would analyse the morphology of the 4th word of the 2nd verse of the 1st chapter of the Qur'an. The bot will also show the syntax of the verse the word is in, if the data is available.


#### +mushaf
sends the page containing a Qur'anic verse on a standard mushaf.
```
+mushaf [surah]:[verse]
```
For example:
```
+mushaf 1:2
```
The above would send an image of the page containing Qur'an 1:2 on a *Medina Mushaf*. 

If you want a page with color-coded *tajweed* rules, add 'tajweed' to the end of the command.

For example:
```
+mushaf 112:1 tajweed
```



### Tafsir (Commentaries on the Qur'an) 

#### +atafsir
allows you to quote from over 37 Arabic *tafaseer* (commentaries on the Qurʾān). A list of valid *tafaseer* is available:

`+tafsirlist`

```
+atafsir [surah]:[verse] [tafsir]
```

For example:

```
+atafsir 2:255 tabari
```

The above command would quote the tafsir of Ayatul Kursi from Tafsir al-Tabari.


#### +tafsir
allows you to quote the English tasfir (commentary) of verses from Tafsīr al-Jalālayn (`jalalayn`), Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr (`ibnkathir`), Tafsīr al-Tustarī (`tustari`), Rashīd al-Dīn Maybudī's Kashf al-Asrār (`kashf`), al-Qurayshi's Laṭāʾif al-Ishārāt (`qurayshi`), Tafsīr ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-Kāshānī (`kashani`) and al-Wahidi's Asbāb al-Nuzūl (`wahidi`). It works in the same manner as **+atafsir**.

```
+tafsir [surah]:[verse] [jalalayn/ibnkathir/kashf/tustari/qurayshi/kashani/wahidi]
```

For example:

```
+tafsir 1:1 ibnkathir
```
The above command would quote the tafsir of Surah al-Fatihah, verse 1 from Tafsir Ibn Kathir.

#### +dualist

#### +dua
allows you to get duas from *Fortress of the Muslim* (Hisn al-Muslim).

```
+hadith bukhari 1:2
```
